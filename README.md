# NewProject

This repository contains an example Bitcoin dashboard built with Bootstrap and Chart.js. The page works completely offline using bundled assets and sample data.

## Dashboard

Open `dashboard.html` in your browser or via a simple local server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

The dashboard displays the latest sample price and a line chart. It updates every few seconds with random fluctuations to simulate live data.
